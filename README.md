# Animal_Crossing_Godot_Theme
Godot Theme based on Blathers, an owl character from the game series Animal Crossing. The files include instructions to get the full effect, preview images and a .tet file to add to your editor which changes the Script Editor colors. Colors are picked from Blathers' feathers, belly, beak and bow-tie!
